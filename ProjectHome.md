This is a collection of various add-ons for PRTG Network Monitor (version 8 and later) from Paessler AG and their source code - created by Paessler as well as the user community of PRTG.

PRTG Network Monitor (http://www.paessler.com/prtg) is a network monitoring software from Paessler AG (http://www.paessler.com). There is a freeware download available as well as commercial editions.

PRTG can be translated into other languages and it can be extended using a number of interfaces:

  * Writing Custom Sensors (executables, WMI scripts, powershell scripts, etc.)
  * Creating web pages that publish system data for HTTP Content sensors
  * Tools that use the HTTP based API (e.g. notifier tools for various platforms)

On this project you can find things as

  * [Billing Tool](BillingTool.md)
  * [Pre-Built Custom Sensors in binary form](http://prtgtoolsfamily.com?page=downloads_sensors)
  * [Pre-Built Custom Notifications in binary form](http://prtgtoolsfamily.com?page=downloads_notifications)
